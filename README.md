# CodeAlpha_Calculator
I built a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Project Breakdown:
HTML: Structured the calculator with a display area and buttons for digits, operators, and essential functions like AC (all clear), DEL (delete), and = (equals).
 CSS: Designed a modern and sleek user interface with a gradient background, stylish buttons, and a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
 JavaScriptâ€‹: Implemented the core functionality, enabling the calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and handle user input efficiently.
